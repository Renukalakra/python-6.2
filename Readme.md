what is python ?

- python is simple, easy and portable.
- python is free & open source programming language.
- python is high level, interpreted programming language.
- python is developed by Guido van Rosum.
- python is interpreted language means when we write python code its executed the code line by line thats why we called python is interpreted language.
- In python, ("print") is a function to give output statement in python. simply we can tell "print" is output function.


character set of python language. :-

1. letter -> A-Z, a-z
2. digits -> 0-9
3. special char.. -> -,+,/,* etc..
4. whitespace -> Blank Space, tab, newline..


What is variable in python ?

- a  variable is a name given to a memory location in a program or else we can simply say variable is a container to store some data.
- ex. name = "shradha"
 age = 23
salary = 23000.00
- In the above example the name, age & salary is our variable names & shradha, 23, 23000 is our variables values.


Rules for writing identifiers :-

- identifiers -> variables name 
- Identifiers can be combined of uppercase & lowercase letter, digits or an underscore(_). ex. myVariavle, variable_1
- An identifiers can not start with digits. so ehile "variable1" is a valid but "1variable" is not valid.
- we can not use special symbols like - !,#,@ etc...
- Identifiers can be of any length.
- Variable name should be small and meaningful like - when we give our age is that case we take the variable as "myAge". (myAge - camel case letter).


Data types :-

- It means which type of data we have used in our variable name so that is called data types.
- 'type' is a operator to show the datatype name in our variables like which type of datatypes we use in our variables.
- mainly data types are of 5 types in python.
- These data types are unmutable or build-in data types.
1. Integer -> +ve value, 0, -ve value
2. String -> "hello", "shradha".. etc..
3. Float -> 3.91, 4.00, 9.01 etc..
4. Boolean -> True & False
5. None -> not assign any values.


Comment Line :-

- comment line, means these lines will not executed. 
- there are 3 types of comment line are there
1. single line comment - it hide the single statement (#code - symbol)
2. Multi line commment - it hide sime multiple statement("""code"""- symbol)


Operator in python :-

- simply we can say operator is a symbol that perform a certain operation between operands.
- ex. a + b
- in the above example a, b is our operands & '+' is our operator.
- there are 4 types of operator are present in python.
1. arithmatic operator -> (+,-,/,*,%)
2. Relational operator -> (==, !=, >,<, <=, >=)
3. Assignment operator -> (=, +=,-=,*=,/=,%=)
4. Logical operator -> (and, or, not)


Input in python :-

- input() statement is used to accept values (in keyword) fron user.


task to do for practice :-

1. write a program to input 2 numbers & print their sum.
2. write a program to input side of a square & print its area.
3. write a program to input 2 floating point numbers & print their average.
4. write a program to input 2 int numbers a & b, print True if a is greater then or equal to, If not print false.


Git :-
- git is a open source, version control system where we store, save, retrieve, deplay & collaborate our code in one platform.
- there aare many git tools we used to fo these things, there are github, gitlab...etc

Reposetory :-
- It is folder where we put our code in a folder structure, every project need a personalized resperetory.

commit :-like save, we save our file on that reposetory.
publike:-
